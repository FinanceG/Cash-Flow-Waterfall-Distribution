# Cash-Flow-Waterfall-Distribution
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that models the Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) Cash Flow Waterfall Distribution. The model simulates the distribution of cash flows among various CLO tranches, considering priority of payments, fees, interest, and principal allocations.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
Structured Finance Modeling: Implements a cash flow waterfall structure for CLOs.

Tranche-Level Analysis: Computes cash flow allocations across equity, mezzanine, and senior tranches.

Dynamic Cash Flow Simulation: Models different scenarios for loan repayments, defaults, and reinvestments.

Python & Jupyter: Uses Pandas, NumPy, and financial modeling techniques for calculations.
